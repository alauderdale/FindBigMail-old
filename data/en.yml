  imap_folders_limited: Reasons why all of your big emails might not be labeled
  imap_folders_limited_answer_1: |
                                  We've mentioned before how %s can make the emails in those folders be skipped during the labeling process.
  imap_folders_limited_answer_1_link_label: hiding folders from the IMAP protocol
  imap_folders_limited_answer_2: |  
                                  Besides hiding Gmail folders from IMAP, you can also limit the number of returned emails.  People usually do this because they are using an IMAP client and only want to see the most recent emails.  Doing this however means that some emails are never "seen" by the FindBigMail service.
  imap_folders_limited_answer_3: |
                                  If you've turned this on but want FindBigMail to find all your big emails, exit your IMAP client, turn off this option within your Gmail %s as shown in the following image.

  imap_folders_limited_alt_text: Choose 'Do not limit the number of messages in an IMAP folder'
  imap_folders_limited_answer_4: |
                                  After your scan completes you can return this option back to the limit you choose.
  large_chat_histories: Why don't my large chat histories appear in the scan results?
  large_chat_histories_answer_1: |
                                  Occasionally we're asked why large %s don't appear in the scan results. They appear in 
                                  Gmail, so why can't FindBigMail see them?
  large_chat_histories_answer_1_link_label: chat histories
  large_chat_histories_answer_1_link: "http://www.google.com/support/talk/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=29289"
  large_chat_histories_answer_2: |
                                  The reason is that Google doesn't make them available via their Gmail APIs (specifically 
                                  the IMAP apis) that we use to find your large emails.
  large_chat_histories_answer_3: |
                                  The vast majority of people aren't likely affected by this. Chats tend to be all text 
                                  and thus quite small -- relative to the very large images, audio and video files that 
                                  consume the vast majority of available space and give you those pesky "out of space" messages!
  remove_fbm_labels: How do I remove FindBigMail labels?
  remove_fb_labels_answer_1:
    After you've found all your large messages and created some more free space, you may wish 
    to remove the labels that FindBigMail created to help you.
  remove_fb_labels_answer_2: "The following Google article describes: %s including deletion."
  remove_fb_labels_answer_2_link_label: how to use Gmail labels
  remove_fb_labels_answer_2_link: "http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=118708"
  remove_fb_labels_answer_3: |
    As we've discussed in this FAQ: %s, after your run is complete we no longer have access as 
    we remove it as soon as the run is done. We only leave behind the labels. Technical note: 
    We've found that the messages will still retain the label even after the label is deleted, 
    so if you add the label back again with the exact same name, the messages will magically 
    re-appear. If you don't want this to happen, you can select all the messages with the 
    label and then remove the label from the messages before deleting the label itself.
  remove_fb_labels_answer_3_link_label: How do I uninstall or remove FindBigMail access to my account
  remove_fbm_access: How do I uninstall or remove FindBigMail access to my email account?
  remove_fbm_access_answer_1: |
    We've been asked several times "How do I remove FindBigMail access to my email account?". 
    The short answer is: "We already have!"
  remove_fbm_access_answer_2:
    However, please don't take our word for it. Because we use OAuth and get a token from 
    Google for temporary access, you can verify that we've removed the token at 
    https://www.google.com/accounts/IssuedAuthSubTokens. If you still see FindBigMail listed 
    there, then we're either in the middle of scanning for large emails, or some sort of error 
    occurred that we're not aware of. If we're done (check the status link in the first email 
    we send you to be sure), definitely revoke the token, and please let us know what email 
    address you were scanning so we can find out what went wrong. (We'll run it through our 
    one way hash and then examine the logs).
  remove_fbm_access_answer_3:
    Of course you can test that this all works, by revoking a token in the middle of a scan. 
    It will take a few minutes for the scan to timeout, but you'll get an email saying that 
    we encountered an error and your scan is not complete.
  remove_fbm_access_answer_4:
    By the way, even if something goes wrong and the token wasn't revoked, we don't have it 
    anymore. We don't store the token anywhere, except in memory while the scan is running. 
    By not storing it, we can be more confident that even if our site is hacked, there won't 
    be a treasure trove of tokens to steal -- or even a list of email addresses, because we 
    don't keep those either!
  remove_fbm_access_answer_5:
    We're trying hard to make this simple and secure. If you have more questions or 
    suggestions, please get in touch.
  known_issues: Are there any known issues?
  known_issues_answer_1: |
    We have one known issue affecting a small number of people with both Google Apps and Google 
    Accounts that have not yet been merged: %s.
  known_issues_answer_1_link_label: more information
  known_issues_answer_2: |
    Another very small group of users have restricted access to their All Mail folder (see %s). 
    In most cases, this is because they disabled it to keep Apple Mail happy and this can be 
    easily fixed as described in our FAQ: %s. For another even smaller group, their All Mail 
    is available, but not readable. In that scenario, we scan and label all readable folders, 
    which takes longer but achieves the same result.

                          little gremlin and fix or workaround it. We want your search for free space amidst your 
                          gigabytes of storage to be hassle free!
  cannot_scan: I'm logged in to Google correctly but can't run a scan.
  cannot_scan_answer_1: |
                          We've had lots of scans by people hosting their email at Google Apps. However, we've tracked 
                          down a problem from someone who had multiple Google accounts and was not been able to run a 
                          scan. In this case the user has a:
  cannot_scan_answer_1_item_1: Google Apps account, e.g. myname@example.com, and a
  cannot_scan_answer_1_item_2: Google Account with the same name, myname@example.com
  cannot_scan_answer_2: |
                          Other people who created Google Accounts before Google Apps existed may well be in this situation, 
                          especially if they subsequently ported their email or entire domain to Google Apps. Google is 
                          in the middle of transitioning everyone to a unified system where these seemingly the same 
                          but actually different accounts will be merged.
  cannot_scan_answer_3: |
                          The problem for FindBigMail appears to be that we get access to the Google Account, which doesn't 
                           have email, instead of the Google Apps account which does. We're looking for a solution. If 
                           you're in a rush, you should check to see if your Google Apps + Account merge can happen sooner. 
                           Many domains have been offered this already (as of mid-Oct 2010).
  cannot_scan_answer_4: "Some useful links:"

  my_privacy: What do you do with my email address?
  my_privacy_answer_1: |
                      We recently changed our Privacy Statement to reflect some auditing and cleanup we did on our 
                      logs. Unlike many websites of late, this increased your privacy. We don't like the responsibility 
                      of having your email address so we work very hard to never see it and to never store it anywhere 
                      that someone might find it. This is how we treat your email address:
  my_privacy_answer_1_item_1: we use it once to send you an initial "we're starting, here's where to get status" email
  my_privacy_answer_1_item_2: |
                              we %s your email address using a one way code so it looks something like 
                              b852fb9f7c5d851875ef6fa282f1f859 and that's what we store in our logs. We can't ever get 
                              your email address back from this, but if, say, someone starts doing lots of runs with the 
                              same email address, this allows us to detect it. Or, if you %s with a question, we can 
                              take the email address you give us, calculate the hash, and then check our logs.
  my_privacy_answer_1_item_2_link_label_1: hash
  my_privacy_answer_1_item_2_link: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function"
  my_privacy_answer_1_item_2_link_label_2: contact us
  my_privacy_answer_1_item_3: we send you a final results email when we've finished your scan
  my_privacy_answer_1_item_4: |
                              we 'forget' your email address - an easy thing to do, because we never stored it anywhere, 
                              except in memory while we ran your scan
  my_privacy_answer_2: |
                      Of course, we never ever see your password. With your authority, Google gives us a temporary 
                      token to find big emails in your mailbox, and we explicitly invalidate that token when we're done 
                      (you can double check permissions at Google's site %s).

  scanned_folders: Only my inbox was scanned, what about the other folders?
  scanned_folders_answer_1: |
                              The most effective way to find free space in your email is to scan every email in your 
                              Gmail account. Normally we do this by looking for the "All Mail" folder (including some 
                              tricks to account for local languages) and then scanning the size of those messages.
  scanned_folders_answer_2: |
                              However, sometimes (about 0.5% of scans so far), we cannot find the "All Mail" folder. 
                              In those cases we scan the Inbox and mention it in the summary email.
  scanned_folders_answer_3:  |
                              Why does this happen? As near as we can tell, it's because you are using the Google labs 
                              feature that lets you hide Labels from your IMAP client and you have configured your IMAP 
                              settings to hide the All Mail folder. Searching for this in Google suggests that many Mac 
                              Mail users do this to avoid duplicate messages showing up in Spotlight.
  how_large_can_emails_be: How large can one email be?
  how_large_can_emails_be_answer_1: "We see this question a lot on twitter: What is the largest email I can send with Gmail?"
  how_large_can_emails_be_answer_2: |
                                      The answer is 25MB. This is equal to about 5-10 mp3 songs or the same number of 
                                      full resolution photos from a modern digital camera. For video, it's a few minutes 
                                      at most (but video size varies a lot depending where it came from). Careful though, 
                                      as %s, even if you can send 25MB, the person receiving your mail may not be able 
                                      to receive emails that large!

  modify_size_ranges: Can I change the size ranges used by labels?
  modify_size_ranges_answer_1: |
                                  A lot of people are using findbigmail.com to group their largest emails into different 
                                  sizes with great success! One request we've heard a couple of times, is "Can I 
                                  change the label sizes?". The short answer is "not yet", but we are looking into it.

  multiple_size_labels: Why do my emails have multiple size labels?
  multiple_size_labels_answer_1: |
                                  FindBigMail.com labels individual mail messages not threads. In most case, when you see
                                  more than one size label on a thread or conversation, this simply means that the thread contains 
                                  mail messages from all the size labels attached. For example, a thread with both the 
                                  'FindBigMail > 10mb' and 'FindBigMail > 5mb' labels has at least one message that is 10mb 
                                  and at least one other message that is at least 5 mb in size. Deleting an entire 
                                  thread can free up space at multiple levels!
  emails_with_label_size: How large are the emails with each of the labels again?
  emails_with_label_size_answer_1_item_1: "\"FindBigMail > 10mb\" messages are larger than 10,000,000 bytes."

                                  Use these labels to find out what is taking up all that space, so you can free it up 
                                  for the next round of photos, music, videos and similar space hogs!
  remove_labels: How do I remove the labels if I no longer want them?
  remove_labels_answer_1: |
                          If you've freed up all the space you need, you can remove a label completely by logging into 
                          your Gmail account and clicking the small square just to the left of the label in the list of 
                          labels on the left side of Gmail. One of the choices in the drop down that is displayed will 
                          be 'Delete Label'. Select that choice and Gmail will confirm that you want to remove the label. 
                          Then click the 'Ok' button. Removing the label will not remove your email. You can also check 
                          out Google's %s on how to show, hide, and delete labels.

about_us:
  title: Find Big Mail - About Us
  about_us_header: About Us
  about_us_1: |
              This website is brought to you by a couple of veteran software engineers who saw a problem and wanted to 
              solve it. We found that you could in fact run out of email space with Gmail (or Google apps) and then what 
              could you do? How can you fix things when you get "You have run out of space for your Gmail account"!
  about_us_2: |
              Sure, we could hook up an IMAP client and import all the mail (7+GB of it!) and then find the largest and 
              remove it, but that wasn't going to work for friends and family. They had no idea what an email client was!
  about_us_3: |
              So, we have this website. We're both privacy nuts, so we were careful to build it so we never see your 
              password or even your email messages. We just get the sizes and label them accordingly. And then, what the 
              heck, we threw in a report so you could see how much big mail you have.
  about_us_4: "We hope you enjoy it. Please %s if you have any comments or questions."
  about_us_4_link_label: send us an email
  about_us_5: Thanks!

              You can continue to use your email and will start to see results while it is being scanned. This may take 
              just a few minutes or more than an hour depending on your mailbox size and location. We'll send you an 
              email when it's complete.

    We no longer have any information about this scan, most likely because the scan finished a 
    while ago and we've removed the log files.  If you feel this is an error you can re-run the 
    scan below, or contact us. Thanks!

allmailblocked:
  header: "Your scan will take longer than usual"
  body_1: |
    We are unable to access the All Mail folder. Instead we will scan every label (folder) one by one. 
    This may take several hours instead of the usual 10-60 minutes. Also, some of the statistics 
    will be less accurate if you have a lot of large messages that have multiple labels.
  body_2: |
    It's all good though! At the end, your largest messages will still be identified and of course 
    you can keep using your email in the meantime. We'll send you an email when we're done.

allmailimap:
  header: We could not access your All Mail folder
  body_1: |
    We are unable to access your "All Mail" folder because IMAP access has been blocked. To fix this, go 
    into Gmail and find the settings for the Google Labs "Advanced IMAP Feature" as shown.
  body_2: |
    Check the circled box and re-run your scan to find all large messages and reclaim some free space!

  lifehacker:
    If you're running out of space in your Gmail or Google Apps inbox, the quickest fix is nixing the largest 
    attachments you've got stashed. You can't do that from Gmail's web interface - unless you've enlisted 
    Find Big Mail's help.
